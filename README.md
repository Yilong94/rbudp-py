# Reliable Blast UDP in Python

RBUDP is a data transport tool and protocol specifically designed to move very large files over wide area high-speed networks. It is implemented based on details in this [paper](https://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/papers/cluster2002.pdf). Below is simple view of the protocol:

## Getting Started

Work-in-progress

## TO-DO
* Saving bytes in memory and transmission seem to be increasing with time and is slowing down RBUDP. Needs more testing to find the root cause. Possible to make it more efficient
